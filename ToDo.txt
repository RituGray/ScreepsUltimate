ToDos:
----
- optimization on all roles (example: only upgrader should use energy from storage if necessary and other changes)
- after GCL is 2: claim new room and build it up (stable population, upgrade roomcontroller, build towers and other structures)
- additional roles: guard, monk, knight, ranger, etc. (see Role ideas below)
- modify all screeps: "panikroom", building roads (maybe a thing for the constructor), etc. (see Role ideas below)
- working with a defcon level like: https://arcath.net/2016/12/screeps-part-8-constructors-defcon
- more testing and optimization on the AI of the screeps on my on server
- testing with bots
- testing on a real server

Role ideas + modifies for existing roles (ideas from "Pantek59"):
----
- dont use all energy to spawn creeps like harvester
- (1) new role "constructor" -> evertime new GC Level is reached puts the new buildings in specific layout --> https://docs.screeps.com/api/#ConstructionSite
- (1) modify "builder": -> only spawns if there is a construction site, after building go upgrade till death
- (1) modify "creeps": -> go to save-flag if enemies come to the room, after that go back to work
- (1) modify "creeps": -> set automatically construction sites for roads as they walk
- (5) new role "energy hauler": -> transport energy from remote stationary harvesters back to spawn room
- (1) new role "miniHarvester": -> needs only 200 energy, if all creeps die and not enough energy is stored
- (1) new role "protector": -> spawns if "Panic Flag" is set and goes there to protect this room
- (1) new role "remoteHarvester": -> harvest sources in remote rooms, can set the "Panic Flag"
- (3) new role "remoteStationaryHarvester": -> like a miner just in a remote room and can build container if there is no
- (2) new role "demolischer": -> spawned if "Demolisher Flag" is set and dismantles construction site
- (2) new role: "scout": -> runs to other rooms and tells if he is attack or if he find hostile/other creeps
