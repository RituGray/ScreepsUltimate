ToDos:
----
- optimization on all roles (example: only upgrader should use energy from storage if necessary and other changes)
- all screeps (with work-bodypart) get the upgrader or collecter funktionality if they have nothing else to do
- after GCL is 2: claim new room and build it up (stable population, upgrade roomcontroller, build towers and other structures)
- additional roles: guard, healer, knight, ranger, etc. (see Role ideas below)
- modify all screeps: "panikroom", building roads (maybe a thing for the constructor), etc. (see Role ideas below)
- working with a defcon level like: https://arcath.net/2016/12/screeps-part-8-constructors-defcon
- more testing and optimization on the AI of the screeps on my on server
- testing with bots
- testing on a real server
